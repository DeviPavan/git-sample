Jenkins backup:
1. Create a new server and install jenkins on it
2. Create some jobs on the jenkins server

3. Create an S3 bucket on AWS to store the back up of jenkins directory - jenkins-backup-18feb
-->Go to AWS dashboard-->search option give S3-->

TO allow AWS ec2 server to write into AWS s3 bucket we need to

> Create a IAM role for amazons3fullaccess for EC2

> Attach the role to jenkins Ec2 server-->actions-->security-->IAM role


Now stop jenkins server from terminal
====================================
# systemctl stop jenkins

# tar -zcvf jenkins-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/jenkins
# ls
Install Aws cli
# apt-get update && apt install awscli -y 

Run the command to send the tar file to s3 bucket.

# aws s3 cp jenkins-backup.tar.gz s3://jenkins-backup-demo/jenkins-backup.tar.gz

Package awscli is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'awscli' has no installation candidate
solution:
You're getting the error because the awscli package is not available in your default APT sources. This commonly happens on older or minimal Debian/Ubuntu-based AMIs (especially on EC2).

To fix it, follow these steps:

1. Update package list

# sudo apt update

2. Install required dependencies

# sudo apt install -y curl unzip

3. Manually install AWS CLI v2

# curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
# unzip awscliv2.zip
# sudo ./aws/install
4. Verify installation

# aws --version

Expected output (example):
aws-cli/2.15.12 Python/3.11.5 Linux/x86_64 exe/x86_64.ubuntu
